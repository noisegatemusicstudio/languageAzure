"Low quality, poorly tested app. App wanted me to make clown faces one day and wouldn't let me access my account. Contacted support who said I needed to scan my ID card again. However the app has failed to recognise my ID the hundred or so times I've tried to scan it. The image on screen while attempting to scan is blurry and so out of focus that even I can hardly recognise it's an ID card, yet the image from the camera app is crystal clear. I seriously think they're using the camera preview API.",UX UI

This is the most difficult app I have ever come across. The scanning of the HKID and the scanning of the face can never be successful. I would love to see the developer of this app to operate it in front of me.,Scanning HKID

"Was asked to rescan my HKID, but the steps requires me to tilt the ID card, then moves the frame too fast and at a very large angle, and then fails you immediately when the user cannot catch up, making the process impossible to complete. Makes me wonder if the change has been tested at all before rollout. What's worse, I'm blocked from ALL other functionality in the app so I can't even use the so-called new ""Chat with me"" function to get help.",Device support

"Infuriating!!! I'm sat there for twenty minutes or more before completely giving up doing a FACE SCAN. In the middle scanning it stops and says ""we cannot scan you face - please follow the instructions"". Well, perhaps it's the instructions or the software that is wrong because I'm pretty sure I know how to put my face IN A CIRCLE! üò°üò°üò°üò° I used this all the time on my old phone, now I have a new one I need to use the ridiculous face scan to identify myself and I can't get on!
