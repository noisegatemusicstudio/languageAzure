Review: I'm sat there for twenty minutes or more before completely giving up doing a FACE SCAN. In the middle scanning it stops and says "we cannot scan you face - please follow the instructions". I used this all the time on my old phone, now I have a new one I need to use the ridiculous face scan to identify myself and I can't get on! Madness!
